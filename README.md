## Features
- I used @media queries and flexbox to make a responsive layout
  - The navbar has two differents views depending the size of screen
  - The evolutions of pokemon is horizontal when large screen and vertical on a small screen
  - The cards of each pokemon is responsive for large and small screens
  
- To favorite a pokemon, the application saves the favored pokemon in the localStorage of browser.
  - If the pokemon is already favored, then It get removed

- When using pagination, the application uses sessionStorage to save the current page, e.g: you are in the page 5 and open the pikachu details, when you go back to Home page, the pagination are open in the page 5 instead of page 1.
  - The data only get downloaded from API according the changing page
  - When the page changes a new request is made

- The search only let the searching if the input is filled
  - You can search by writting the pokemon's name or its number
  - To search you can press Enter key or clicking on the button
